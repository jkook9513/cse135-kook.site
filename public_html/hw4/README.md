## AI Use

I used AI for various purposes for this project. Since I was working alone, it was useful for tedious work such as frontend design and bug fixes. It was very useful throughout the course of this project

## Future Features

Given more time, I would like to expand on the data I am currently collection. I would also like to work on the frontend design more and have the navigation flow be more smooth. I would also like to work on a real authentication system with sign-ups.
